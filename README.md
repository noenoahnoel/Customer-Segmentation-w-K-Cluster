# Customer-Segmentation-w-K-Cluster

Using sample sales data I applied RFM(Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value) analysis to create customer segments. 

Customer Segmentation is the process of dividing customer into different groups based on these characteristics for effective marketing.

RFM (recency, frequency, monetary) analysis is a marketing technique used to determine quantitatively which customers are the best ones by examining 
how recently a customer has purchased (recency), how often they purchase (frequency), and how much the customer spends (monetary).
